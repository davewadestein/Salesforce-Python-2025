## Homework: Day 1
* make sure you have the quick labs / lab for loops working
* if you need help, use ChatGPT or Code Genie as needed
* consider writing down the steps in English, then passing those steps to AI
   * if you do the above, be sure you understand the generated code
* if you want to go further, ask ChatGPT/Claude/etc. to give you exercises that are similar
   * if AI gives you code which uses constructs we haven't learned yet, ask it to rewrite for beginner (or "don't use XXX construct")
